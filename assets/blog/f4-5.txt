In federalist papers 4 and 5, Jay continues with his analysis of foreign threats. He starts off with this idea that wars are not only started based on just causes. Any number of "pretended" causes, such as national pride, ethnic hatred, or the wishes of individual monarchs, can lead to war.

He discusses the possible threats to America in the world at that time from other countries growing jealous of our superior supply chain, and cheaper products. With France controlling the end of Mississippi river, and Britain controlling Saint Lawrence in the North, we may encounter hostilities over time. Furthermore, America's trade with India and China needs to be protected.

Jay reiterates some points from the previous paper. He lists several reasons a federal government might have more success in deterring and engaging in conflict with foreign forces. A centralized force will have better coordination, more powerful command, and larger talent pool. He quotes Queen Anne's speech to the Scottish parliament where she argued for the union of England and Scotland. Britain's success can be attributed, for a large part, to its union. Would the individual nations have the strongest navy in the world? Would they be able to trade freely over the seas as they do now?

If we were to divide into a few confederacies instead, some of them would surely rise, economically and militarily, above others. This imbalance can induce aggression from the stronger side. Even if we from a group of balanced confederacies, there is not guarantee that will remain the case in the future. These distinct nations will form distinct treaties, distinct relations, and distinct alliances perhaps with other nations. History has shown that divided groups will not prosper as much as united ones do.
