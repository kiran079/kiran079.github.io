Today is one of those rare days
When warm words wets my eyes
And I listen on loop
Until all meaning is lost

The romanticization of the chorus
The essence of the story
The emotions in those lines
In my own heart
I meant not lay bare

Today will pass
This realization will pass
This intense desire will pass
And the soul will dry 

But today,
I get to take it all in
And live the story anew
Only for a moment
Only in my head

I will cherish it
While I have it
For I never can have it
