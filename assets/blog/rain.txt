Rain, pour your pleasant sound
Cleanse the night fog away
Wet this unforgiving ground
And let the empty streets stay

Lighten the clouds in the sky
And darken the roads below
Free the hammer from so high
And continue the summer show

Make the stale streams spill
Drop with all your might
And flatten all of this hill
Rain, sing your song tonight

Pour onto the side of my window
Be my friend in the dark night
And watch me sleep in your glow
Rain, sing your song tonight
