After having some time to reflect on the events that have transpired in Nepal over the past few days, I have some words to share.

First of all, every politician and persons involved in the decision to use lethal force, up and down the chain of command, needs to be held responsible for the murder of those kids exercising their right to assemble and protest. Period. There is no justification for shooting school kids indiscriminately in the manner that was done. The names of those that fell that day will be entrenched in history forever and justice must be served.

Secondly, as someone not living in Nepal, I am far removed from the consequences of any political instability, but I do still feel the pain and sadness as I watch my country descend into chaos. I have no sympathy for the politicians whose houses were burned down. When I was a kid, I remember overhearing names of politicians in the background as my grandpa watched TV, promising development and prosperity, and it is those same names I'm hearing today that, having been in power for well over a decade, have brought about the opposite in this country. That said, destruction of the parliament, the courts, airport, and other public and private property is unacceptable. The rioting and the mob justice mentality cannot stay and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.

Finally, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in our country's history. What lies ahead is a an unknown. Whatever it may be, we must remember how we got here. We can never forget the souls lost along the way. I hope we can emerge a stronger nation from the depths of darkness. We cannot let the death of these martyrs go to waste, and we cannot let mob mentality overtake our consensus. Where the previous generations failed, we must succeed in building a resilient and corruption free nation.
