The clock hits six
The routine clicks
In the warm summer dawn
I put my shoes on

The breeze brushes my skin
The sun greets the clouds
I find myself here again
Where the roads diverge

A short one
That takes me to the end
A long one
That lets me pretend

So, I take the long way
Across the river and the mountain
Where the spiders prey
And the volcanos create a fountain

Why the long road?
Why the treacherous journey?
Why the fierce battles?
Why the unbearable heat?

Well, the angel lives in woods
Between the spider's den and the river
But the forest is large and dense
Yet to be blessed with her presence

Still, I wake up with no fear
Batting my own sweat and tear
Still, the long way I go
Though for it, I have nothing to show
