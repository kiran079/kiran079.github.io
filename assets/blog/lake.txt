A lake at the bottom of the valley
Spreading its tentacles across every nook
Twisting to every corner of the land
Into the expanse, but quietly still

Feeding the green and grey life above
As they come and go with no care
It watches, it waits, it withers
But time, like sand, can never stay

A yellow leaf, descending slowly
Inevitably to face its feeble fate
To gently brush the surface
Of the ever so still lake

Ripples, spreading on to every inch
Breaking the mirror so fragile
Startling the everything underneath
Then another, and another, and another

And as the last says goodbye,
The first schemes anew
