A ball rolling up on the hill
For Sisyphus to conquer its peak
The birds working their beak
In the night against my will
And here I am, waiting still

Waiting for the sun to shade
Waiting for the stone to sand
Waiting for the salt to sweet
Waiting for the sense to sleep
Waiting for the swan to speak

I would hold the racks
If one was given to me
I would swing the axe
If one was given to me

I would sieve the bay
If one was given to me
I would erase it away
If one was given to me

And I would listen late
I would if I was given
Given on a royal plate
Given a clean slate

But who is there to give?
The sun can never give shade
A swan speaking can never live
A stone solid can never fade

Wait leads on to wait
But I know of nothing else
