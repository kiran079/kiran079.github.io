"Life is too short, enjoy every moment" Often, these feel like empty cliches, but for some reason, there are moment of clarity that come up - five minutes before bed, when you're in the middle of watching a movie, when you step out onto the balcony to get a breath of fresh air, when you're sitting alone at a party, looking around the room and time feels slow, when you daydream about your future, when you look back at some memory that you can't stop thinking about. 
In those brief moments, something shifts â€” you truly feel what those words mean.
It is in those same moments that you promise yourself to live fully, to make that call to invite someone for lunch you said you would, to strike up a conversation with someone you promised yourself you would. Only if this clarity lasted. Only if.
