Gently do my eyes open
Snow white blur covers my sight 
For a moment, I think they’re broken
But no, are these walls winter white?

Does the floor kiss the ceiling in the horizon?
Or five feet away, do the walls stand?
Can I touch the walls of this mysterious Maison?
Or to the echoless end, do they expand?

On the floor they lay, blacker than coal
Lines, parallel, as fast as the eyes can see
From beneath my feet, to the end of the soul
How could it not be drawn by He?

Turning, peaking, slowly so
Boundless, naturally, they are not
Like crooked sharps on an endless piano
From a knot, perhaps they are brought

Few inches from my feet, the origin lay
Stunned for a second, then I look back again
Doubled the divide, how have they?
Oh the view, how I miss from back then

Bravely ahead, I look once more
As my genesis fades behind in the distance
Origins in front, now pop on the floor
Oh, how they seem like eternal subsistence

Now, I stand on what might be a ray
Where nothing ever can truly be caught
Wonder if I’ve seen all my eyes can lay
But the piano’s crooked more than I thought

Eternal, endless, now I can’t pretend
Rays, relentless, how I wish they were
Sudden, swift, one finds the end
How black turns to white so fair

Space between the lines, never to be filled
The fine floor feasts on the soul
This art is its only skill
Be painted over, when will my coal?

In minutes, days, or years, I know not
And the void allows no detour
In this trap, are we not all caught?
Now, at least I know for sure

The lines will travel without me the same
As the have traveled with me in this game
