The faint, constant crying inside the ear
Battered by the brief rustling of the wind
The still air pulled in and pushed out
Outdone by the occasional breath of the machine

A cup of pure pathetic plain water
Stack of books, never turned past the preface
Six string in the corner of the room
Shining still, but a few worn out spots

Locked onto the portal to other dimensions
At the mercy of the ever eroding mind
Hovering, floating, drifting, sliding
Falling, crashing, sinking, plunging

Until the curtains can no more
Until dusk births dawn again
