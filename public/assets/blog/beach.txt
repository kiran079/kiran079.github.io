Marks on the dry sand
At the edge of the shore
Entrenched deep within
Footsteps in each direction more

Can the waves wash it away?
A strong one pushes past
The water recedes, pulling on the grains
But the holes seem to last

Can the wind blow it away?
Constantly at work, never to rest
Grazing at the uneven surface
But the nests, it can not test

Can time erase it away?
Days, months and years pass,
And the rugged canyons soften
The peaks and valleys cannot stay like glass

Only time may restore the shore
Only time may close that door
