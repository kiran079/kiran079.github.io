The scene of flowerbed all around
Each with its unique smell on the nose
All glowing above the same ground
Where each day grows a new rose

On some night, my sense is caught
Outshining all the usual ones,
The pretty petals peek from the far away spot
Protected by pointy thorns overrun

I grab it nonetheless
On the second day I eyed the glow
Red dripping on the stem so fresh,
My palm can not stay like so

The hand goes back to my side,
The flower, covered in red dirt
Now has no place to hide
With the smell still overt

The next day, the next day,
My nose first finds it out
The ground's empty where it lay
My own doing has brought this about

At least I would've had the sight
At least I would've had the smell
Be it from afar
Be it from afar
