Crashing waves roar all around
Under the dark night sky
Sharp rocks under my feet all drowned
All dark, in the open I lie

The cold water covers my throat
The sharp rocks hold me steady
In the distance, is that a boat?
Oh how far, can it be here already?

Have I seen this boat before?
Have I slashed my hopes before?
No, it can’t be. It can’t be.
To the sea, I plea

But alas, the waves keep me still
For I do not have the strength to push
As I indulge in this thrill
For this is my own ancient ambush
